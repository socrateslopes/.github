# Sócrates Lopes—@socrateslopes
Hello! I'm Socrates—a tech manager at [Nubank](https://github.com/nubank). At Nubank we are reinventing what's possible to redefine people's relationship with money. My main topics of interest are Software Architecture, Group decision-making, Agile Methods & Human Factors in Computing Systems 💻

## My values
🤝 Fairness<br>
💖 Honestity<br>
🚀 Nobody is left behind<br>
🤯 Open-minded

## How I work
I strongly believe that technology can enhance our capabilities as human beings. That's why I co-authored with [Namiki](https://github.com/mynamiki) the [Software for Happiness](https://pt-br.eventials.com/Globalcode/tdc-poa-2018-stadium-sexta-4/) movement. I also consider that software development is a social process, rather than a purely technical activity, and having an agile mindset is key to achieving good results for everyone.
