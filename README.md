## How I work
I strnogly believe that technology can enhance our capacities as human beings. That's why I believe in [Software for Happiness](https://pt-br.eventials.com/Globalcode/tdc-poa-2018-stadium-sexta-4/). I also believe that software development is a social process, rather than a pure technical activity, and having an agile mindset is key to achieving good results for everyone.
